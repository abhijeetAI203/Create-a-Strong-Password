## ✅ Analysis and Key Learnings

### 🔎 Observations:
- *Simple passwords* like hello123 can be cracked in seconds.
- Adding *uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols* improves strength significantly.
- *Longer passwords* (16+ characters) provide much greater security and resistance to brute-force attacks.

### 🛡 Best Practices:
- Use passwords with at least *12–16 characters*.
- Include a mix of *uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols*.
- Avoid common dictionary words and personal information.
- Use *passphrases* (e.g., Sky!Runs#Fast2025) for memorability + strength.
- Consider using a *password manager* to generate and store complex passwords securely.
